**OracleTrace** helps you find Python slowdowns early by tracing function calls, comparing execution runs, and showing a clean call graph.

## What is OracleTrace?

OracleTrace is a lightweight Python execution tracing tool built for practical performance analysis.

Use it to:

- Detect performance regressions between script versions
- Compare baseline and new trace runs
- Inspect per-function timing and call counts
- Visualize caller to callee flow with a readable tree
- Automate performance checks in CI pipelines

## Why use it instead of a heavy profiler?

Most profilers are great for deep optimization work. OracleTrace is focused on quick day-to-day regression checks.

You get fast answers to questions like:

- What became slower after this change?
- Which function improved?
- Did new calls appear in this run?

## Core features

### Performance comparison

Compare two JSON traces and instantly spot:

- Slower functions
- Faster functions
- New functions
- Removed functions

### Execution trace metrics

For each function:

- Total execution time
- Call count
- Average time per call
- Caller and callee relationships

### Call graph visualization

Understand execution flow at a glance through a structured logic tree.

### JSON export for automation

Store results and plug them into:

- CI performance gates
- Historical regression tracking
- Custom analysis scripts

### CSV export for reporting

Export flat metrics for spreadsheet workflows and external dashboards.

### Regression gates for CI

Use `--fail-on-regression` and `--threshold` to fail builds only when slowdowns pass your tolerance.

## Quick command preview

```bash
oracletrace my_app.py
oracletrace my_app.py --json baseline.json
oracletrace my_app.py --json new.json --compare baseline.json
oracletrace my_app.py --json new.json --compare baseline.json --fail-on-regression --threshold 10
```

## How OracleTrace works

OracleTrace uses Python's built-in `sys.setprofile()` hook to capture `call` and `return` events, then aggregates function-level timing and call relationships.

It filters out non-project code so output stays focused on what you actually own.
