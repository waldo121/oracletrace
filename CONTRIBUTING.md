# Contributing to OracleTrace

Thanks for your interest in contributing to OracleTrace.

OracleTrace is focused on practical Python performance regression detection: lightweight tracing, clear comparison output, and useful CLI workflows.

Contributions are welcome for:

* Performance regression detection improvements
* Trace comparison quality
* CLI usability
* Output clarity and visualization
* Documentation and examples

---

## Before You Start

* Read [README.md](README.md)
* Check docs under https://kaykcaputo.github.io/oracletrace/
* Browse open issues, especially good first issues:
  https://github.com/KaykCaputo/oracletrace/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22

---

## Development Setup

### 1. Clone your fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<Your-User>/oracletrace.git
cd oracletrace
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install in editable mode

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 4. Verify CLI

```bash
oracletrace --help
```

---

## Project Structure

* [oracletrace/cli.py](oracletrace/cli.py): CLI arguments and command flow
* [oracletrace/tracer.py](oracletrace/tracer.py): tracing engine and output rendering
* [oracletrace/compare.py](oracletrace/compare.py): baseline vs current comparison logic
* [docs/docs](docs/docs): documentation pages
* [docs/mkdocs.yml](docs/mkdocs.yml): docs configuration

---

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/short-description
```

### 2. Make focused changes

Keep PRs small and scoped to one clear objective.

### 3. Validate locally

Run the checks in the Validation section.

### 4. Commit and push

Use clear commit messages and push your branch.

### 5. Open a Pull Request

Explain the motivation, what changed, and expected impact.

---

## Coding Guidelines

* Prefer simple, readable solutions over complex abstractions
* Keep behavior changes explicit and documented
* Preserve existing CLI behavior unless the PR is intentionally changing it
* Follow existing style and naming patterns
* Avoid new dependencies unless clearly justified

---

## Validation

This repository has automated CLI tests with `pytest`. Run tests before opening a PR.

### Automated tests

```bash
pytest
```

### CLI smoke check

```bash
oracletrace --help
```

### Functional trace run

```bash
oracletrace your_script.py
```

### JSON export and compare flow

```bash
oracletrace your_script.py --json baseline.json
oracletrace your_script.py --json current.json --compare baseline.json
```

### CSV, ignore, and top flags

```bash
oracletrace your_script.py --csv trace.csv
oracletrace your_script.py --ignore "helper_function,debug_*"
oracletrace your_script.py --top 10
```

### Docs build (if docs changed)

```bash
mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml
```

---

## Documentation Contributions

### Required

- [mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org)
- the packages listed in `mkdocs -f docs/mkdocs.yml get-deps` must be installed in your python environment

If your PR changes flags, behavior, output format, or workflows:

* Update the relevant page in [docs/docs](docs/docs)
* Keep examples executable and aligned with real CLI behavior
* Ensure docs build succeeds

---

## Issue and PR Templates

Use the GitHub templates when opening issues and pull requests. They keep reports consistent and speed up review.

### Issue templates

* Bug report: [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
* Feature request: [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
* Question or discussion: [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/question_or_discussion.md`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/question_or_discussion.md)

When opening an issue, provide enough detail for maintainers to reproduce or evaluate quickly:

* Expected behavior and actual behavior (for bugs)
* Minimal reproduction steps
* Python version and OS/environment details
* Exact commands and output when relevant

### Pull request template

All pull requests should follow:

* [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

The template includes:

* Required validation commands
* Checklist items for style, tests, CI status, and docs updates
* Before/after output section for behavior changes

Please complete all relevant sections before requesting review.

---

## Pull Request Tips

* Keep PRs small and focused
* Link related issues (for example: Closes #123)
* Add before/after output snippets when changing CLI behavior
* Highlight any backward-incompatible changes

## Questions

If anything is unclear, open an issue.

Discussion is welcome and encouraged.
